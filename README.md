# DevU-Documentation

## Introduction

DevU is an automated software-grading platform being developed at the University at Buffalo. DevU aims to be incredibly extensible, allowing professors to add any functionality they desire without reaching a dead end. It will eventually replace Autolab and other services. You can access it at <https://devu.app/>

This repository will serve as a guide, primarily for instructors and students, on how to use DevU.
